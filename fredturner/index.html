	<h1> FROM COUNTERCULTURE<br/> TO CYBERCULTURE </h1>

		<article id="article1">



			<h2> "Computers will be the new LSD"</h2>
			<h3> Stewart Brand </h3>

			

			<p> At the beginning of the 90s, experts saw in the creation of the internet the birth of a virtual community. The web made possible the overpassing of physical boundaries and opened an era of virtual communion. This utopia find its roots in the american counter-culture, most commonly known as <span>the hippies</span>. A parallel can therefor be established between the drugs circulating in this community for their act of "opening minds and connecting people" and their interest for the concept of the internet : a virtual land independant from state control.  </p>
